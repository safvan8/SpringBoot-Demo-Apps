	 * and finding entities.

	 * The ICoronaVaccineRepo interface also extends the PagingAndSortingRepository
	 * interface, which provides additional methods for pagination and sorting of
	 * entities.

	/**
	 * In Spring Data JPA, when you define a repository interface that extends one
	 * of the predefined repository interfaces (such as JpaRepository,
	 * CrudRepository, or PagingAndSortingRepository), Spring Data JPA will
	 * automatically generate a proxy class that implements the methods defined in
	 * the interface.
	 * 
	 * This proxy class is responsible for creating and executing the appropriate
	 * database queries based on the method names and signatures defined in the
	 * interface.
	 * 
	 * The code generation process is done at runtime, using the metadata available
	 * for the entity classes and the repository interfaces. This means that you
	 * don't have to write any boilerplate code to implement the repository methods
	 * yourself.
	 * 
	 * The generated code can be customized using various techniques such as Query
	 * Methods, Native Queries, and QueryDSL. This makes it possible to define
	 * complex queries and combine them with pagination and sorting functionality
	 * without writing any SQL code.
